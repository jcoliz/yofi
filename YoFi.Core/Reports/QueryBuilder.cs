    /// This class has the unenviable task of building EF queries for
    /// the various scenarios we might want to report about, specific
    /// to this application's data.
    /// 
    /// The challenge is building queries that EF can translate later on
    /// when month/category groupings are built. Sometimes it can't be done
    /// in which case we'll turn it into a client-side query here.
    /// 
    /// Note that all public methods return an IEnumerable(NamedQuery) because
    /// this is what the Report class expects as a source, even if there is only
    /// a single query in it.
    /// 
    /// Architecturally, this class is a challenge. It absolutely represents
    /// busines logic, and needs to know all about the conceptual structure
    /// of our data. At the same time, it is tightly bound to the abilities
    /// of EF Core to general MS SQL Server queries.
    /// 
    /// So, while this class does consume an IDataProvider, and therefore has
    /// interface separation, if we were to provide an IDataProvider backed
    /// by some other store, it's highly likely that this class would need
    /// some work.
